Version : 2021 September 14, jscharwaechter, change target groups to
folders, move science arcs into target folders, updates to xml
templates
Version: 2024 March 11, jscharwaechter, removed baseline arcs (now
taken with the science)

Target and conditions information from the Phase I observations only
needs to be entered into the template science observations. Daytime
calibrations must have special target names and flux standard
observations must not include target components.

The OT libraries have different acquisition observations for different
acquisition strategies (point source, blind offset, 2 targets,
extended source). The template library uses a standard point source
acquisition as the default.

Observations are now identified by library IDs, indicated with {}

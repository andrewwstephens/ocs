Observations are identified by library IDs, indicated with {}

PI = Phase I
{} = Library ID

  IF FILTER == {K1 or K2}:     # Sky required
    INCLUDE {1} {3} {4}
    CHANGE FILTER in {4} to H  # See Filter Change note below

SET OBSERVING MODE FROM PI (all included observations)

# Filter Change:  the goal is to leave the mode the same but change the filter from {K1 or K2} to {H}.  For example, if the mode is "Coronagraph K1" change it to "Coronagraph H".  If it is "K2 Direct" change it to "H Direct".  If it is "Non-Redundant K1" change it to "Non-Redundant H".

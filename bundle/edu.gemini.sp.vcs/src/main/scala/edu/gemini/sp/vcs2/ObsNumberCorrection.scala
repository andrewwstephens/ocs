/** Corrects observation numbers such that all local-only observations have
  * numbers greater than the maximum remote observation number.
  *
  * There are a few implicit assumptions at work here.  First, once an
  * observation has been created its key is always remembered in the
  * `VersionMap` (that's true of any node actually).  Second, as new
  * observations are created they are given the next sequential integer.
  * That is, observation numbers aren't reused when deleted.  Finally
  * observation numbers are never modified once assigned (other than by
  * the merge plan application itself).
  *
  * This means that there cannot exist an observation known to both local and
  * remote program versions with an observation number greater than a
  * local-only observation.

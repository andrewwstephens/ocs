<h1>Welcome to Observing Tool</h1>

<hr>

<p>This is the Gemini Observing Tool (OT), which is used to develop and plan Phase 2
Science Programs for the Gemini telescopes.</p>

<p>Click below on the appropriate button to create a <b>New Program</b>, to <b>Open</b>
an existing local or remote program, to <b>Manage</b> your keychain, to search the database
with the <b>OT Browser</b>, or to <b>Import</b> a program from XML.</p>

<p>The Observing Tool is the work of the Gemini Observatory staff including Bryan Miller, Andrew Stephens, and the software engineers Arturo Nunez, Sebastian Raaphorst, Carlos Quiroz, Rob Norris, Shane Walker, and many former employees.</p>

<p>The image at left shows Jupiter at 4.7 microns taken with NIRI on Gemini North. Many short images were taken to "freeze" the blurring due to the Earth's atmosphere and the sharpest 10% were combined to produce this image. It is the highest resolution infrared image of Jupiter taken from the ground. The bright regions are the glow from warmer regions in the interior that are not blocked by higher clouds.
</p>

<p>Contact Bryan Miller (bmiller@gemini.edu) for more information.</p>

<p>The Observing Tool uses Java code from a number of other projects
and we would like to thank them for their work.

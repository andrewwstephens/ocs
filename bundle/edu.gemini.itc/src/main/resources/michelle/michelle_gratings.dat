# Data obtained from observations and otherwise estimated
# 
# Note that echelle coverage and resolution roughly scale with wavelength. If
# the ITC cannot accommodate this it should assume two echelles, as indicated
# below, one for 7-14um and one for 16-26um
#
# Blaze wavelengths are reference wavelengths given below
#
# d_lambda is the resolution in nm - constant in wavelength for the gratings
# d_lambda and R are for 2 pw (0.38") slit for lowN, medN1, medN2, and
# EchelleN, and 3pw (0.57" for lowQ and EchelleQ
# nm/pixel is the dispersion for unbinned pixels
